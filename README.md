# Information-Security
This report explores the security challenges and defense strategies for AI-powered systems in smart homes, focusing on the interplay between potential attack methods and corresponding mitigation techniques. It begins by discussing the use cases of AI-integrated devices like smart thermostats, security cameras, and voice assistants, highlighting their benefits and vulnerabilities.

The analysis is structured into key sections:

Attack Strategies – Explains methods like adversarial attacks, data poisoning, inference attacks, and model inversion, which threaten the integrity, privacy, and functionality of smart home systems.
Defensive Approaches – Proposes solutions such as adversarial training, anomaly detection, encryption, and access control mechanisms to counteract these threats.
Balancing Security and Efficiency – Discusses the trade-offs in implementing robust defenses for resource-constrained smart home devices without compromising their performance or usability.
Additionally, the report introduces attack and data flow models to visualize vulnerabilities and provide a structured understanding of potential threats. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of combining robust defenses with efficient, lightweight solutions to ensure security without degrading system performance. The team collaboratively contributed through research, model development, and report writing, supported by referenced academic works.
